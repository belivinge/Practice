# Research Project
I am working with POLARIS, a newly developed three-dimensional Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, to calculate dust temperature, polarization maps, and spectral energy distributions. The code is designed to effectively process data generated by advanced magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. Its primary objective is to preprocess and evaluate multi-wavelength continuum polarization measurements in relation to magnetic field research in the interstellar medium. One notable application(which I am working on) is examining how magnetic fields influence the processes of star formation.

Approaches: We integrate contemporary theories on grain alignment with established algorithms for dust heating and polarization. The POLARIS code undergoes testing across various scales within intricate astrophysical systems associated with diverse stages of star formation. POLARIS employs a comprehensive range of dust polarization mechanisms to delineate the magnetic field morphology.

Findings: The resultant temperature distributions align with the density and positioning of radiation sources derived from magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) collapse simulations. The determined layers of aligned dust grains in circumstellar disk models are in strong agreement with theoretical predictions. Additionally, we generate distinctive patterns in synthetic multi-wavelength polarization maps, contingent upon the applied dust model and grain alignment theory within analytical cloud models.
