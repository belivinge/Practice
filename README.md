# Research Project
I am working with POLARIS, a newly developed three-dimensional Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, to calculate dust temperature, polarization maps, and spectral energy distributions. The code is designed to effectively process data generated by advanced magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. Its primary objective is to preprocess and evaluate multi-wavelength continuum polarization measurements in relation to magnetic field research in the interstellar medium. One notable application(which I am working on) is examining how magnetic fields influence the processes of star formation.
